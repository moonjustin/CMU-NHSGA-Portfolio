# Justin Moon's NHSGA Portfolio

These are some projects that I completed for my Advanced Computer Science course at school. 

1. Bogosort: This program takes an array of numbers, and performs Bogosort until the numbers are fully sorted.
2. PathFinder: Given an M x N rectangular grid, this program prints all possible routes in the grid that start at the first cell (0, 0) and end at the last cell (M - 1, N - 1). It can move down, right, or diagonally (down-right), but not up or left.
3. SortAndSearch: This program takes an array of strings, sorts it, and then searches for a user inputted string using Binary Search.

Thank you for your time!
